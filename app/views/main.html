                                    Writing clean, effective and maintainable code is essential for any long-living software product. By neglecting that fact, teams bring up a time bomb - step by step, imperfection creeps into the code, infecting different parts of the system until it is put on knees. Continuously keeping internal structure of a product in a good shape is a big challenge for the team - it takes years to master a ream of substantial techniques, practices and patterns… But the project has already begun. In this training, in short time you’ll find out how to write code that you, your colleagues and followers will adore. This, in turn, will make your products and customers shine.

                                  Automation makes people supervisors in place of pipeline operators. Suprisingly, everything except creative human work can be automated. It's time for your team to work on creative and inspiring things and leave machines to do the rest. Eliminate human-prone manual testing by introducing all-round testing automation. Learn how to organize effective testing process using (A)TDD, write functional and cross-functional tests targeting RESTful APIs and UI, implement stress-testing and produce business-facing acceptance tests using Cucumber and Relish.

                                  A domain model lies in the heart of every enterprise application. Nowadays developers spend too much time on "surrondings", tackling deeply technical, challenging issues. However, it's a core domain that makes business spin, therefore deserves extra attention. Domain-Driven Design or DDD is an excellent way to tackle complexity in the heart of software and make it far more understandable and manageableby by connecting software model to the mental model of end-users. Unfortunately, developers find DDD pretty hard to grasp because of poorly-written materials available online, lack of good examples and industry-spread experience. Because of this, vitally important practice is left aboard, making the system rigid, fragmented and hard-to-adapt. In fact, DDD is  pretty simple if attacked from the right perspective. Learn how to do both tactical and strategical DDD right.

                                We see unit testing as one of the most important practices in software development. Unit testing allows you to write better code, faster. When it is done right it helps you to grow software projects with significant quality and confidence. When done wrong, testing brings no value but overhead, developers are pissed off and it's a question of time when vital practice will get completely abandoned. We believe that you should care about unit tests as much as your main codebase, that’s why we are offering this course — to show you how to do unit testing the right way.

                                Specification by example is a collaborative approach to defining requirements as executable examples instead of abstract statements. It is applied in the context of agile software development methods. This approach is particularly successful for managing requirements and functional tests on large-scale projects of significant domain and organisational complexity. 
                                The workshop is based on Gojko Adzic's books "Bridging the Communication Gap" and "Specification by Example", as well as our personal experience developing, leading and testing software development projects using this approach.

                                Spring Framework is the most widely used framework in Java world and thence demands extra attention from developer's perspective. Our experience shows that functional richness of Spring comes with a cost — usually it gets overused and misunderstood which leads to hard-to-maintain projects. This training will cover Spring in details and teach you how to apply it properly in large, multi-module projects. 
                            </p><p>Become master in Spring by learning it's deep phylosophy and evolution path, best practices and common pitfalls. Start architecting complex but easy-to-understand software with Spring, explore advanced functionality that goes behind basic IoC, dive deeply into internals of core framework and spread your knowledge by integrating it with various 3rd party frameworks like Hibernate or DropWizard.

                                    In the age of agile software development and cross-functional teams, everyone is an architect. Software architecture is not about big up-front design with UMLs and circles on the whiteboard - it's about practices and techniques you have to follow in order to keep design clean under a rain of changing requirements, things that are extremely important for fighting design entropy. As a professional developer you should know how to cope with evolutionary design and avoid "code &amp; fix" insanity. Spread your knowlege beyond coding — learn how to lead the way and do "just enough" software architecture by youself. Define, ensure and articulate software architeture in your team, maintain technical vision and keep balance with agility.

                            Yes, we share the same feeling as you do — it's pity to see how nowaday's software development looks like. Remember weeks spent on writing specifications, unfulfilled expectations, delays, poor quality, huge development and maintenance costs, arguing with stubborn developers that don't get your ideas right. Step back, we can't fix mainstream because it's fundamentally broken. "Agile" doesnt't help much, as it's applied on top of the broken model. Such phenomenon reminds us putting lipstick on a pig. That's why we offer <strong>fresh and opinionated view on software development</strong>, leaving mainstream behind. We eliminate artificial walls between business &amp; product-oriented IT experts which leads to close and creative collaboration. In this way, your product gains the best from both worlds. Add transparency, excellent quality, short feedback cycles and some fun to the soup and you'll have the best software development journey ever.

                            Software development usually reminds the boiling frog story. We work side by side with you, watch your back and protect your project from getting boiled. It's our duty to reveal and prevent problems as early as possible and make sure your project is done in a timely, professional manner. It's like having an insurance. But unlike insurance that mitigate failures, we prevent them from happening.
